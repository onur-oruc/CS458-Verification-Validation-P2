# CS458-Verification-Validation-P2

In this project, we implemented a mobile-native COVID-19 vaccine survey page, and then tested it using Appium.

Source code is in "CS458-Verification-Validation-P2/App.js" file and test code is in "CS458-Verification-Validation-P2/__tests__/appium_test.js" file
in the repository.

To run the codes, if you have a relevant version of Android Studio installed, then follow these steps:

- Use "npm run android" command in the project root directory to run the source code and application (detailed info: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- Using Appium desktop application, start server.
- Find the test code and run it.
